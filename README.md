### Structure

- **Main components** have to be exported in `./src/main.js`. Main Components should be in folder `./src/components`.
- **Ui Elements** for main components should be in `./src/components/ui` so everyone who contributes can see if there is an element/component already for their use.
- Components should be as small as possible to make the code easier to access and understand, thats why the directory structure has importance.
- Every logic/function according to articles/items/cart or anything else should be in the `cartStore` in `./src/stores/cart.js` - reason is as follows - all components get their data with so called props which are not "reactive" by nature. We want to trigger a rerender if we change/add/edit... items thats why anything according to that should be in the cartStore. Read the cartStore carefully and use the already existing states to grant a clean rerender/reactive process. The props all get updated as soon as the main states get updated in the `cartStore` -> rerender --> profit...

Try to understand this structure and adopt it with new components for easy implementation without much effort.

Real documentation is coming soon...
